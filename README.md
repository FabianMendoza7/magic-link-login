# Magic Link Login

This is a simple but powerful example that will show you how to build a web
application with Deno Fresh that allows users to sign up and sign in with a
magic link provided by Supabase, as well as update your profile data, including
your profile photo.

This repo will demonstrate how to:

- Sign users in with Supabase Auth using a magic link sent by email.
- Store and retrieve data with the Supabase database.
- Store image files in Supabase storage.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend:
  - [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started): a modern framework for
    creating the web application, through the use of `Deno` and `Preact`.
  - [Supabase.js](https://supabase.com/docs/library/getting-started): client
    library for user management and real-time data syncing.
- Backend:
  - [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/): hosted Postgres
    database with restful API for usage with Supabase.js.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create new project

Sign up to Supabase -
[https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and create a
new project. Wait for your database to start.

### 2. Run "User Management" Quickstart

After your database has been initiated, navigate to your project's `SQL Editor`
and click on `Quickstart`, then on `User Management Starter`, which generates a
script for the creation of a public `profiles` table accessible through your
API. Finally, press the `RUN` button to execute the script. Once this is
complete, proceed to the `Table Editor` to view your newly created `profiles`
table.

### 3. Get the URL and Key

Access Project Settings (via the cog icon), open the API tab, and locate your
API `URL` and `anon` key; these are required for the next step.

The `anon` key is your client-side API key, providing "anonymous access" until a
user logs in. After login, the keys switch to the user's login token, enabling
[row-level security](https://satoricyber.com/postgres-security/postgres-row-level-security/).

**_NOTE_**: The `service_role` key has full access to your data, bypassing any
security policies. These keys have to be kept secret and are meant to be used in
server environments and never on a client or browser.

### 4. Setup

#### Config env vars

In the `supabase` folder, open the `config.json` file, and set the value of the
following variables with the `URL` and the `anon` data respectively:

```
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

#### Extensions

For a better development experience, install the `Deno` extension from the
`denoland` publisher in Visual Studio Code.

#### Caching

Download in the local cache all of the project's dependencies, by running the
the following command:

```
deno cache dev.ts
```

### 6. Run the application

Run the application with the command `deno task start`. Open your browser doing
click on the link `https://localhost:8000/` that appears in the terminal, and
you are ready to go ðŸš€.

### 7. Usage

It is very simple, a picture is worth a thousand words:

### 8. Deploy

Once the application is ready, deploy it to the cloud. A quick alternative is
through [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). Copy the deployed URL. In the
Supabase Dashboard, go to the `Project Settings` / `API` option, and replace the
URL in the `Project URL` section with the one copied to the clipboard. Save the
changes. Test the application again but this time in the cloud.
